# PingSpy - ICMP Traffic Monitoring Tool

## Overview
PingSpy is a network monitoring tool designed to analyze ICMP traffic for suspicious activity. It captures ICMP packets on a specified network interface, analyzes them for anomalies, and provides reporting capabilities.

## Features

- **Real-time ICMP packet capture** - Monitors a specified network interface for all ICMP traffic
- **Anomaly detection** - Identifies suspicious patterns in ICMP traffic including:
  - Unusually large payloads
  - High frequency of ICMP packets
  - Potential ICMP tunneling (encapsulated protocols)
- **Customizable thresholds** - Adjustable sensitivity levels for detection
- **Reporting** - Generate detailed reports of captured ICMP traffic
- **Interactive command interface** - Control and configure the tool while running

## Installation

1. Ensure you have libtins (Tins library) installed
2. Compile with a C++11 compatible compiler:
   ```
   g++ -std=c++11 pingspy.cpp -o pingspy -ltins
   ```

## Usage

```
./pingspy
```

When started, the tool will:
1. Display available network interfaces
2. Prompt you to select an interface to monitor
3. Begin monitoring and analyzing ICMP traffic

### Interactive Commands

While running, you can enter these commands:

- `do_report` - Create a report with ICMP dump
- `show_dump` - Print ICMP dump to console
- `exit` - Exit the program
- `help` - Show all available commands
- `turn_on_devmod` - Enable developer mode (allows unsafe settings)
- `turn_off_devmod` - Disable developer mode
- `change_lower_level_of_susp_detection <level>` - Change lower suspicion threshold
- `change_upper_level_of_susp_detection <level>` - Change upper suspicion threshold
- `chint <milliseconds>` - Change analysis interval
- `impsettings` - Import settings from pingspysettings.txt
- `expsettings` - Export current settings to pingspysettings.txt
- `settings` - View current settings

## Configuration

Settings can be adjusted either:
1. Interactively while the tool is running
2. By editing pingspysettings.txt
3. By exporting/importing settings files

Key configuration parameters:
- `port` - Network interface to monitor
- `lower_level_of_susp_detection` - Minimum suspicion score to trigger warning
- `upper_level_of_susp_detection` - Score to trigger critical warning
- `edege_of_suspicion_payload_weight` - Payload size threshold (bytes)
- `freqwency_of_analysing` - Analysis interval in milliseconds

## Detection Methods

PingSpy uses several heuristics to detect suspicious activity:

1. **Payload Size Analysis** - Flags ICMP packets with unusually large payloads
2. **Packet Frequency** - Detects high rates of ICMP traffic
3. **Protocol Encapsulation** - Identifies potential tunneling of other protocols (TCP/UDP/ICMP) within ICMP payloads

## Output

The tool provides three levels of alerts:
1. **Suspicious activity** - Moderate suspicion score
2. **Extremely suspicious activity** - High suspicion score
3. **ICMP tunneling detected** - Evidence of protocol encapsulation

Reports include:
- Timestamps
- Source and destination IP addresses
- Full payload contents

## Limitations

- Currently only monitors ICMP traffic
- Requires root/administrator privileges for packet capture
- False positives possible with custom ICMP implementations

## Security Considerations

- Running in developer mode (`devmod`) allows unsafe configurations
- The tool itself could be used maliciously if modified
- Always verify alerts before taking action
